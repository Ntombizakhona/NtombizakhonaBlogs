# How To Study Effectively
## During The Pandemic

Even though the future is uncertain, and everything may seem continuously confusing and overwhelming at times…thanks to the constantly changing academic and just overall structure of our lives, you can still make the best of the year and study effectively, happily and stress free during this unprecedented time…

## 1. Have A Schedule or Timetable (Purchase One Here)
A detailed action plan for the day, week or even month will help ensure that you actually meet and achieve your study goals, as a matter of fact, it might even help you meet other goals. If you don't know how to set up a timetable or schedule, well, free to purchase a Schedule/Planner by The Student Analyst.

## 2. Stay Hydrated: Drink Adequate Amounts Of Water
I'm sure you know this by now, but it is important to drink adequate amounts of water when you study, and just in general. If you're dehydrated, you won't retain any knowledge and information - which will just make your effort at studying useless. Water is life, get enough of it - not too much, not too little, just enough. Adequate amounts: five to eight glasses should be sufficient.

## 3. Eat Nutritious Food
You have to eat food that is nutritious, and contains various multivitamins to help boost brain function, and help you study better. You won't achieve much on an empty stomach, and you will suffer even more with your studies if your main source of food is not nutritious. You do not have to let go of your favorite snacks, but it is important to adopt a lifestyle that contains quite a lot of nutritious food. If, for some strange reason, you are unable to let go of sugary drinks, and foods, well, get the Sugar Detox Powder by Perfite.

## 4. Exercise Daily
Mental and Physical Health is a holistic, interconnected experience that requires persistent fitness habits and a consistently healthy lifestyle, towards studying effectively. It entails the persistent and continuously consistent combination of maintaining a healthy diet and leading an active lifestyle in order to be mentally astute and physically competent, and thus reap major benefits from your studies. If you don't know how to incorporate exercise into your study regimen, well, get an appropriate Personalized Fitness Program by Perfite.

## 5. Make Time For Your Hobbies Or Get A Hobby
You don't have to turn into a hyper-productive bunny, have breaks, and reserve time for hobbies. Hobbies are an important way to relax, and do something just for fun. The great part about hobbies is that you might monetize them in the future. If you don't have a hobby, well, why not delve into Web Development, Machine Learning or Cloud Computing by checking out these Top Five Free Sites To Learn Something New?

## 6. Communicate & Ask For Help
No man is an island, and if you are struggling with something, ask someone for help. This could be a teacher, a fellow student, your friends or even your family members, just ask! Don't sit in a little corner of confusion by yourself, thinking that you can solve everything by yourself in your head. You are not the first person, nor will you be the last person to be faced with whatever problem you believe is isolated and only relevant to you. Others will definitely help, in one or another.

## 7. Plan Ahead and Stay Ahead
You need to plan ahead, and stay ahead so that you are able to continuously get back on track whenever unforeseen circumstances occur. You do not want your studies to overwhelm you at any point in time.

## 8. Adequate Sleep
Sleep is actually important. Too little sleep: bad. Too much sleep: bad. You need to sleep for an adequate amount of sleep, perhaps between five to eight hours. Sleep will help you retain information, elevate brain function and help with your overall energy.

## 9. Study to Understand, Don't Just Memorize
Studying to understand will make your life so much easier when the time for tests and examinations arrives. You won't have to 'cram' or try to remember random facts. Ensure that you understand something, this will provide a stable foundation for your future endeavors.

## 10. Have Virtual Fun On Social Media
Due to the pandemic at hand, socializing with your friends, meeting new people and playing certain sports might not be possible. Therefore, you can have fun by posting little videos on social media, especially TikTok and participate in relevant challenges. You don't have to study 24/7, because all work, and no play, makes Jack a dull boy.

**I wish you well with your studies.**
